In theory this would work. 

We have the test files floating about in the root directory. Which Django says is normal practise, would make more sense to have the test files in the app but whatever,

Call "python runtests.py test" to run tests.

This means we can have the test folder in a nice ish place and break it up into multiple files without bothering the main code.

However python imports are messy, I can't get them to work and you have to redefine everything that django already does in manage.py in runtests.py. 

Life is too short.

However, you can use "python ../manage.py test" to benefit from having all the tests here away from the main code but not having to re write stuff
Downside, the command is a little annoying.
